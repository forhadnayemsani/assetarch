There’s nothing more frustrating than spending time and effort with a contact who is not in the position to make a purchasing decision. No one wants to hear “I’ll have to run it by my manager” after they’ve spent time preparing and presenting.

Your reps should quickly determine if the person they are dealing with is a decision maker with the authority and budget to buy.

Early conversations should include the following two questions:

“Who else, other than you of course, will be involved in the buying decision?”
“Could you describe the process you will be using to make this decision?”
Once your salesperson has determined if their contact has the authority and ability to buy, they will want to better understand the decision-making process and the structure of the decision-making unit.

  Your reps have a target to hit. What they don’t have is time to spend with prospects who aren’t in a hurry to make a decision.
Coach your salespeople to use open-ended questions to identify if a prospective client has an established timeline.

If they have a need and are aware of it, but are unclear on timing, your salesperson doesn’t have to throw them back out to sea. Have them set a meeting in the future to circle back, or hand the lead back to marketing to continue to nurture until the time is right.Your reps have a target to hit.
